## React Redux Project: Codecademy Store

Build a program that mimics [Codecademyâ€™s online store](https://shop.codecademy.com/). The application will:
- Display products from the Codecademy store
- Allow user to add products to their cart. 
- In the cart, allow user adjust the quantity of each item
- Display total price at the bottom
- Allow user choose the currency for the entire application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

### Available Scripts
Run `yarn install` inside the project's root directory (make sure you have Node installed on your computer)

Run `yarn start` and open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

Open [https://codecademy-store-qnn.netlify.app/](https://codecademy-store-qnn.netlify.app/) to view it in deployed version.
